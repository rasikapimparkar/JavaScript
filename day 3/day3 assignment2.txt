var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.
An example will clarify the difference even better
Example of var:

Input:
console.log(x);
var x=5;
console.log(x);
const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.

Example: const a =10;

function nodeSimplified(){
  const MY_VARIABLE =10;
  console.log(MY_VARIABLE);  //output 10 
}
As per usual, naming standards dictated that we declare the const variable in capital letters. const a =10 will work the same way as the code given above. Naming standards should be followed to maintain the code for the long run.

Question: What will happen when we try to reassign the const variable?
Consider the following code snippet.

function nodeSimplified(){
  const MY_VARIABLE =10;
  console.log(MY_VARIABLE);  //output 10
  MY_VARIABLE =20;           //throws type error
  console.log(MY_VARIABLE); 
}
